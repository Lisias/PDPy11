# Using PDPy11 with Sublime

1. Copy `PDPy11.sublime-build` file to sublime package directory. To open this directory, press *Preferences* -> *Browse packages* and then go to `User` directory.
2. In `PDPy11.sublime-build` file, change `<path_to_pdpy11>` to the correct path, like: `~/Documents/pdpy11`.
3. Then, in case you're using MacOS or Linux, or any other \*nix system, make `pdpy11/sublime/subl.sh` executable by issuing `chmod +x path/to/pdpy11/sublime/subl.sh`.
4. You're now ready to go. Open some *.mac* file and press `Ctrl + B`, or `Ctrl + Shift + B` in case you have several build system for *.mac* files.
